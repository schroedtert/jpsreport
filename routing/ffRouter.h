 * \section Description
 * This router is an update of the former Router.{cpp, h} - Global-, Quickest
 * Router System. In the __former__ version, a graph was created with doors and
 * hlines as nodes and the distances of (doors, hlines), connected with a line-
 * of-sight, was used as edge-costs. If there was no line-of-sight, there was no
 * connecting edge. On the resulting graph, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm was
 * used to find any paths. In the "quickest-___" variants, the edge cost was not
 * determined by the distance, but by the distance multiplied by a speed-
 * estimate, to find the path with minimum travel times. This whole construct
 * worked pretty well, but dependend on hlines to create paths with line-of-
 * sights to the next target (hline/door).
 *
 * In the ffRouter, we want to overcome hlines by using floor fields to
 * determine the distances. A line of sight is not required any more. We hope to
 * reduce the graph complexity and the preparation-needs for new geometries.
 *
 * To find a counterpart for the "quickest-____" router, we can either use
 * __special__ floor fields, that respect the travel time in the input-speed map,
 * or take the distance-floor field and multiply it by a speed-estimate (analog
 * to the former construct.
 *
 * We will derive from the <Router> class to fit the interface.
 *
 * Questions to solve: how to deal with goalID == doorID problem in matrix
 *
 * Restrictions/Requirements: Floorfields are not really 3D supporting:
 *
 * A room may not consist of subrooms which overlap in their projection (onto
 * x-y-plane). So subrooms, that are positioned on top of others (in stairways
 * for example), must be separated into different rooms.
 *
 * floorfields do not consider z-coordinates. Distances of two grid points are
 * functions of (x, y) and not (x, y, z). Any slope will be neglected.
