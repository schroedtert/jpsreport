* Adding new Benchmark tests for JPScore
1. find out the number of the last existing test. For example test_101 (in general n)
2. copy the directory template_test into a directory, e.g. test_101
3. rename the file script.py into runtest_101 (101 beeing the number of the test as in point 2.)
4. git add your directory test_101 after writing some smart tests. The test will automaticaly be considered for the next nightly build. 

Let's see if JPScore can pass it.. ;-)
