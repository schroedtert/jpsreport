** TODO test_4
- NO boundary conditions yet!

** TODO test_5
FAIL
- Pedestrians do not start *precisely* according to the assigned premovement times

** DONE test_6
CLOSED: [2015-06-28 Sun 19:22]

** TODO test_7
PASS
- Strange behavior when taking std=0.2 --> check the distribution [[file:test_7/velocity_distribution.png][FIGURE]]

** TODO test_8
FAIL 
3D building
- can not run simulations

** TODO test_9
CHECK
- both rooms are in the same geometry. Left: 4 doors. Right: 2 doors.
- The evacuation time should be doubled?

** TODO test_10
FAIL
- @Ulrich: The pedes don't consider taking Exit to Goal 0 (Haupteingang)

** TODO test_11
PASS
- @Ulrich: only 3 peds (from 1000) choose the second exit 

** DONE test_12
CLOSED: [2015-06-29 Mon 15:27]
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2015-06-29 Mon 15:27]
- Maybe we have to slightly modify the geometry like PTV did. We do
  not have a "buffer" room at the end

** TODO test_13
- @Mohcine: We have to make the transition to/from stair smoother 

** TODO test_14
- @Ulrich: Can we have the state "confiurable"? Or anything other than "short"?
