-	Edited all master_ini.xml:
	Deleted the lines which told that 8 kernels need to be used

-	Edited all runtest_rimea_x.py:
	Added the remarks to run a new dedicated console if the code is used with spyder


-	Test_1:
	-	No changes needed. Added some notes to clearify the pythoncode.
		Made the geometrydata more readable.


	Test_2:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.
		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Rimea)

	-	Added some notes to clearify the pythoncode. Made the geometrydata more readable.

	-	Changed the geometrydata.
		Before:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	10.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(136)

		Now:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	8.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(100) = 10


	Test_3:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.
		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Rimea)
