-	Edited all master_ini.xml:
	Deleted the lines which told that 8 kernels need to be used
Test_1:
	-	No changes.


Test_2:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.

		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Check Rimea)

	-	Changed the geometrydata.
		Before:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	10.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(136)

		Now:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	8.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(100) = 10 (Check Rimea)


Test_3:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.
		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Check Rimea)

	-	Changed the geometrydata.
		Before:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	10.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(136)

		Now:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	8.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(100) = 10 (Check Rimea)
	
Test_4:


Test_5:
	-	Changed the calculation of the frame when the pedestrians start moving.
		Before:
		Taking the frame when the pedestrian already moved for 1 fps.
		---> Error of 1 fps is to be considered

		Now:
		Taking the frame when the pedestrian is going to move.
		---> No Error to be considered.

Test_6:
	-	No changes.



Test_7:
	-	Changed the number of distributed pedestrians from 4*150=600 to 4*50=200

	-	Changed geometrydata:

		Before:
		Geometry rectangle: width=40, lengt=100

		Now:
		Geometry rectangle: width=50, lengt=40


Test_8:
	-	Changed the number of seeds used from 10 to 1

	-	Fixed a bug, which caused logging the same information over and over again.
		Added a plot, which shows the correlation between the modified parameters.


Test_9:
	-	Changed the number of seeds used from 10 to 1

	-	Rewrote the testfunction


Test_10:
	-	No changes.


Test_11:
	-
