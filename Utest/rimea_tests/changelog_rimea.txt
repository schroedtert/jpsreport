-	Edited all master_ini.xml:
	Deleted the lines which told that 8 kernels need to be used
Test_1:
	-	No changes.



Test_2:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.

		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Check Rimea)

	-	Changed the geometrydata.
		Before:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	10.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(136)

		Now:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	8.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(100) = 10 (Check Rimea)



Test_3:
	-	Changed the calculation of the tolerance of the traveltime.
		Before:
		tolerance = 1
		Now:
		tolerance = +/- 5% of the mean of the traveltime (Check Rimea)

	-	Changed the geometrydata.
		Before:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	10.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(136)

		Now:
		Stairlenght along the x-axis:	8.0
		Stairheight along the z-axis:	6.0
		---> Real stairlenght:		sqrt(100) = 10 (Check Rimea)



Test_4:
	-	Wrong geometry

	-	---> Still needs to be runned for the great amount of peds, but test is fine <---



Test_5:
	-	Changed the calculation of the frame when the pedestrians start moving.
		Before:
		Taking the frame when the pedestrian already moved for 1 frame.
		---> Error of 1 frame is to be considered

		Now:
		Taking the frame when the pedestrian is going to move.
		---> No Error to be considered.



Test_6:
	-	No changes.




Test_7:
	-	Changed the number of distributed pedestrians from 4*150=600 to 4*50=200

	-	Changed geometrydata:

		Before:
		Geometry rectangle: width=40, lengt=100

		Now:
		Geometry rectangle: width=50, lengt=40



Test_8:
	-	Changed the number of seeds used from 10 to 1

	-	Fixed a bug, which caused logging the same information over and over again.

	-	Added a plot, which shows the correlation between the modified parameters.

	-	---> Still needs to be runned for the great amount of peds, but test is fine <---



Test_9:
	-	Changed the number of seeds used from 10 to 1

	-	Rewrote the testfunction

	-	---> Still needs to be runned for the great amount of peds, but test is fine <---



Test_10:
	-	No changes.



Test_11:
	-	Deleted the goal from master_ini and changed routing method from "global shortest" to "quickest" + "triangulation":
		
		Before:
		All pedestrians use the second exit
		
		Now:
		The pedestrians prefer the first exit, but some use the second one

	-	---> Still needs to be runned for the great amount of peds, but test is fine <---



Test_12:
	-	Test working, no changes.



Test_13:
	-	Test working, no changes.



Test_14:
	-	Changed routing method from "global shortest" to "quickest" + "triangulation":
		
		Before:
		No ped uses the longer way, altough its crowded

		Now:
		Peds also use the longer way

	-	Rewrote the testfunction



Test_15:
	-	Wrote the testfunction

	-	---> Still needs to be runned for the great amount of peds, but test is fine <---
