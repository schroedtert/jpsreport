### Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. [Mail us](mailto:dev@jupedsim.org) if you need personal support.

### Requesting features

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our repository. If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

- **Major changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our **dev mailing list** so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small changes** can be crafted and submitted to our repository as a **pull or merge request**.
