## Reporting bugs and requesting features
If you got a question or a problem and need support from our team feel free to contact us.
You can do this via [email](mailto:dev@jupedsim.org).

If you think you found an issue or bug in JuPedSim please use our issue tracker.

### Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. [Mail us](mailto:dev@jupedsim.org) if you need personal support.

- Please do not derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

If you use the issue tracker we have a list of labels you should use.

### Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our repository.
Even better you can submit a pull or merge request with a fix. Please use the following template and make sure you provide us as much information as possible:

### Requesting features

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestions is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

 * Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
 * Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
 * Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
 * Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

If you want to support us by writing the enhancement yourself consider what kind of change it is:

- **Major changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first on our **dev mailing list** so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small changes** can be crafted and submitted to our repository as a **pull or merge request**.

Nevertheless open an issue for documentation purposes with the following template:

~~~

**Steps which explain the enhancement**

2. [Second Step]
