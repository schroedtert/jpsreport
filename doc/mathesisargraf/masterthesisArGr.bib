  Abstract                 = {Increasing number of visitors at large-scale events combined with the increasing complexity of modern buildings set a major challenge for planners, operators and emergency services. Examples include multi-purpose arenas, large railway stations and airports. In this dissertation the use of modern parallel hardware in combination with optimised algorithms are for the first time used on site to speed up the simulation of large crowds. The aim is to perform real-time forecasts of pedestrian traffic. For this purpose, specialneighbourhood lists and a two-stage hybrid parallelisation are used. Thesecond part of this dissertation deals with route choice in complex structures, which plays an important role in achieving realistic computer simulations of pedestrian flows. The developed route choice process is based on visibility and perception of the local environment by the simulated agents. It has as basis a navigation graph. The generation of the graph, espe- cially in complex structures, has also been performed within the framework of this thesis. The work is closed with an empirical study in which the route choice profiles of spectators during various football games and concert performances are analysed and compared with the proposed model. The runtime optimisation strategies and route choice algorithms have been successfully tested in the ESPRIT arena in Düsseldorf (Germany), where they have been integrated in an evacuation assistant.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increasing size and frequency of mass events, the study of crowd disasters and the simulation of pedestrian flows have become important research areas. However, even successful modeling approaches such as those inspired by Newtonian force models are still not fully consistent with empirical observations and are sometimes hard to calibrate. Here, a cognitive science approach is proposed, which is based on behavioral heuristics. We suggest that, guided by visual information, namely the distance of obstructions in candidate lines of sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures to adapt their walking speeds and directions. Although simpler than previous approaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective patterns of motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety of empirical and experimental data. This model predicts the emergence of self-organization phenomena, such as the spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves. Moreover, the combination of pedestrian heuristics with body collisions generates crowd turbulence at extreme densities-a phenomenon that has been observed during recent crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of simultaneous interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes limitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models. Understanding crowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore not only crucial for a better preparation of safe mass events. It also clears the way for a more realistic modeling of collective social behaviors, in particular of human crowds and biological swarms. Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve to improve the navigation of autonomous robots.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we report on a new approach for adaptive path finding in microscopic simulations of pedestrian dynamics. The approach extends a widely used concept based on scalar navigation field -- the so-called floor field method. Adopting a continuum perspective, navigation fields used in our approach correspond to the shortest distances to the pedestrian's targets with respect to arbitrary metrics, e.g. metrics depending on the local terrain. If the metric correlates inversely with the expected speed, these distances could be interpreted as expected travel times. Following this approach, it is guaranteed that virtual pedestrians navigate along the steepest descent of the navigation field and thus follow geodesics. Using the Eikonal equation, i.e. a continuum model, navigation fields can be determined with respect to arbitrary metrics in an efficient manner. The fast marching method used in this work offers a fast method to solve the Eikonal equation (complexity N log N, where N is degree of freedom). Increasing computational efforts with respect to classical approaches only mildly, the consideration of locally varying metrics allows a realistic adaptive movement behavior like the avoidance of certain terrains. The method is outlined using a simple cellular automaton approach. Extensions to other microscopic models, e.g. cellular automata approaches or social force models, are possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many surprising effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by ''phantom traffic jams'' even though drivers all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction in the volume of traffic cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize into lanes, while similar systems ''freeze by heating''? All of these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This article considers the empirical data and then reviews the main approaches to modeling pedestrian and vehicle traffic. These include microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts, such as a general modeling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. While the primary focus is upon vehicle and pedestrian traffic, applications to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are touched upon as well.},

The fundamental diagram , i.e. the density - dependence of the flow or velocity, is probably the most important relation as it connects the basic parameter to describe the dynamic of crowds. But specifications in different handbooks as well as experimental measurements for the fundamental diagram differ considerably. We give a review of the experimental data base and the causes for the discrepancies discussed in the literature. Up to now it was neglected that the way of measurement can cause variations between the results of different studies. To shed some light on this problem we studied by means of experimental trajectories of the single file movement how different measurement methods influence the resulting fundamental diagram.},

A circumstance potential field was defined to simulate the desire to targets. Moving and waiting potential fields were defined to model the interaction. Experiments were run for the model validation and coefficient performance verification. Performances and relationships of sensitivity coefficient, decay coefficient and diffusion coefficient are studied to clarify the effectiveness and flexibility of the presented model in generating pedestrian movement under a variety of situations.
